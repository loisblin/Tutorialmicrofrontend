# Tutorial-Micro-frontend
Microfrontends are an architectural approach that breaks down a large frontend application into smaller, independent applications that work together seamlessly. Inspired by microservices, this approach allows different teams to develop, deploy, and maintain their own parts of the frontend independently.

How It Works
Each microfrontend is a self-contained application that can be built with different technologies (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). They communicate with each other using shared APIs or events. A Host application integrates multiple microfrontends dynamically, often using Module Federation in Webpack, iFrames, or server-side composition.

This approach improves scalability, enables independent deployments, and helps manage large codebases more efficiently.
